# Correct for projector misalignment or cylinder projection
# Correct for brightness inhomogeneities

# Compute a transformation that must be applied to the image prior to projection
# such that it lands properly on the screen 
# That transformation should take into account geometry and pixel intensity 

# Project on a target on the screen (lines/grid), and modify deformation
# accordingly until what is projected matches the target
