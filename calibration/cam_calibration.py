# Correct for defects due to lens distortions
# Relate distance between pixels across the frame to physical distances

# Compute a deformation that needs to be applied to the images prior to 
# processing, such that distances between pixels are constant
# for that maybe take an image of a calibration target (lines/grid) on 
# the screen, and compute the deformation that would make it straight
